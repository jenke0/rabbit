"""Test that an external likelihood term evaluates to a *proper* Gaussian.

An external term is stored expanded,

    -log L_ext = g^T x + 0.5 x^T H x   (+ const [+ lognorm])

so for a Gaussian prior N(mu, C) with H = C^-1 and g = -H mu it is short by
two additive scalars relative to the real thing:

    const   = 0.5 mu^T H mu                     -- centers the quadratic, i.e.
                                                   makes the term 0 at x = mu
    lognorm = 0.5 (k log 2pi - log det H)       -- normalizes the density

Without ``const`` the term reads -0.5 mu^T H mu at the prior mean, so every
absolute NLL on a card carrying an external term is offset by a card-dependent
amount -- invisible in any NLL *difference* taken within one fit (which is why
fits were always right) but wrong in ``nllvalreduced``, ``nllvalfull`` and the
saturated chi2 built as ``2 * nllvalreduced``.

The decisive check here compares two cards that are identical except for the
presence of the term, and asserts that the loss difference equals the analytic
Gaussian evaluated in numpy -- at several points, not just the minimum. That
is what pins both scalars; asserting only the postfit parameter value (as
test_external_term.py does) cannot see a constant at all.
